### Explanation of MongoDB Operations for the `Bank` Collection

#### 1. **Creating the `Bank` Collection and Inserting Documents**:
```js
db.createCollection('Bank');
db.Bank.insertMany([
   { cust_id: 1, cust_name: "John Doe", branch: "Pune", balance: 5000 },
   { cust_id: 2, cust_name: "Jane Smith", branch: "Pune", balance: 7000 },
   { cust_id: 3, cust_name: "Michael Johnson", branch: "Mumbai", balance: 3000 },
   { cust_id: 4, cust_name: "Emily Davis", branch: "Mumbai", balance: 2500 },
   { cust_id: 5, cust_name: "David Brown", branch: "Surat", balance: 10000 }
]);
```
- **Creates the `Bank` collection** and inserts 5 documents representing bank customers with the following fields:
  - `cust_id`: Unique identifier for the customer.
  - `cust_name`: Name of the customer.
  - `branch`: Branch location of the customerâ€™s account.
  - `balance`: The account balance for the customer.

#### 2. **MapReduce Example (Commented Out)**:
```js
// Map function to emit branch and balance
var mapFunction = function() {
    emit(this.branch, this.balance);
};

// Reduce function to sum balances for each branch
var reduceFunction = function(key, values) {
    return Array.sum(values);
};

// Execute the MapReduce function
// db.Bank.mapReduce(mapFunction, reduceFunction, { out: "branch_balances" });
// db.branch_balances.find().pretty();  
```
- **Map Function**:
  - **Emits the branch** and **balance** for each document.
  - The `emit` function outputs the branch as the key and the balance as the value.

- **Reduce Function**:
  - **Sums the balances** for each branch using `Array.sum(values)`, aggregating the values emitted by the map function.

- **MapReduce Execution**:
  - This is a powerful aggregation technique in MongoDB, but it is **commented out** in your code.
  - If executed, it would output the results into a new collection named `branch_balances`.

#### 3. **Using Aggregation to Sum Balances by Branch**:
```js
db.Bank.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: "$branch", total_balance: { $sum: "$balance" } } }
]).pretty();
```
- **Aggregation Pipeline**:
  - **$group Stage**: 
    - Groups the documents by `branch` (`_id: "$branch"`).
    - For each group (i.e., each branch), it calculates the total balance using the `$sum` operator on the `balance` field.
    - The result will be a total sum of balances for each branch.

- **`pretty()`**: Formats the output for better readability.

### Summary of Operations:

- **Creating and inserting data**: The `Bank` collection is created with documents representing customers, including their name, branch, and balance.
  
- **MapReduce (commented out)**: 
  - The map function emits the `branch` and `balance` for each document.
  - The reduce function sums the balances for each branch, but this part is commented out in your code.
  - If uncommented, the result would be stored in the `branch_balances` collection.

- **Aggregation alternative**:
  - The `$group` stage is used to group by `branch` and calculate the total balance for each branch using the `$sum` operator.
  - This achieves the same result as the MapReduce function but is more efficient for simple aggregation tasks like this.

Both the **MapReduce** approach and the **aggregation pipeline** serve similar purposes, but the aggregation pipeline is typically more efficient and easier to use for common operations like this one.
