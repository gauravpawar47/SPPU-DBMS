Let's go through the SQL script step by step:

### 1. **Creating the Database:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE EMP2;
USE EMP2;
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - `CREATE DATABASE EMP2`: Creates a new database named `EMP2` if it doesn't already exist.
  - `USE EMP2`: Switches the active database to `EMP2`, meaning all subsequent operations will be performed on this database.

### 2. **Creating the `Dept` Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Dept (
    deptId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    deptName VARCHAR(10)
);
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - Creates the `Dept` table to store department details:
    - `deptId`: Integer, serves as the **primary key** to uniquely identify each department.
    - `deptName`: A string (up to 10 characters), representing the department's name.

### 3. **Creating the `Emp` Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Emp (
    empId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    empName VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    empSal INT,
    empDeptId INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (empDeptId) REFERENCES Dept(deptId)
);
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - Creates the `Emp` table to store employee details:
    - `empId`: Integer, serves as the **primary key** to uniquely identify each employee.
    - `empName`: A string (up to 10 characters), representing the employee's name. It is **NOT NULL**, meaning it must always have a value.
    - `empSal`: Integer, representing the employee's salary.
    - `empDeptId`: Integer, representing the department to which the employee belongs. This is a **foreign key** referencing `deptId` from the `Dept` table.

### 4. **Inserting Records into the `Dept` Table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Dept (deptId, deptName) VALUES
(10, 'HR'),
(20, 'IT'),
(30, 'Finance'),
(40, 'Marketing');
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - Inserts four records into the `Dept` table, each representing a department with a unique `deptId` and a corresponding department name (`deptName`).

### 5. **Inserting Records into the `Emp` Table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Emp (empId, empName, empSal, empDeptId) VALUES
(101, 'Alice', 25000, 10),
(102, 'Bob', 18000, 20),
(103, 'Charlie', 15000, 30),
(104, 'David', 12000, 40),
(105, 'Eve', 30000, 10);
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - Inserts five records into the `Emp` table, representing employees with their unique `empId`, `empName`, `empSal`, and `empDeptId`. 
  - The `empDeptId` links each employee to a department from the `Dept` table.

### 6. **Listing Employees Belonging to Departments 30, 40, or 10:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Emp
WHERE empDeptId IN (30, 40, 10);
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - This `SELECT` query retrieves all employees who belong to one of the specified departments: 30 (Finance), 40 (Marketing), or 10 (HR).
  - The `IN` operator is used to filter records where `empDeptId` matches any of the values listed (30, 40, 10).

### 7. **Listing Employee Details with Salary Between 10,000 and 30,000:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Emp
WHERE empSal BETWEEN 10000 AND 30000;
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - This `SELECT` query retrieves employee records where the salary (`empSal`) is between 10,000 and 30,000 (inclusive).
  - The `BETWEEN` operator is used to filter salaries within the specified range.

### 8. **Listing Total Number of Employees:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM Emp;
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - This query counts the total number of employee records in the `Emp` table and labels the result as `total_employees`.
  - The `COUNT(*)` function counts all rows in the table.

### 9. **Listing Average Salary of Each Department:**
```sql
SELECT empDeptId, AVG(empSal) AS average_salary
FROM Emp
GROUP BY empDeptId;
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - This query calculates the average salary (`AVG(empSal)`) for each department, grouping the results by the department ID (`empDeptId`).
  - The `GROUP BY` clause groups records by department (`empDeptId`), and the `AVG()` function calculates the average salary for each group.

### 10. **Listing Employee Details in Ascending Order of Salary:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Emp
ORDER BY empSal ASC;
```
- **Purpose**: 
  - This query retrieves all employee records and orders them by their salary (`empSal`) in ascending order (from lowest to highest).
  - The `ORDER BY` clause specifies that the result should be sorted by `empSal` in ascending order (`ASC`).

### Summary of the SQL Script:
1. **Database Creation**: The script begins by creating a new database `EMP2` and switching to it.
2. **Table Creation**: 
   - The `Dept` table is created to store department information with a primary key `deptId`.
   - The `Emp` table is created to store employee details, with a foreign key (`empDeptId`) linking employees to their respective departments in the `Dept` table.
3. **Inserting Data**: Data is inserted into both the `Dept` and `Emp` tables, establishing departments and linking employees to these departments.
4. **Queries**: 
   - The script includes several queries that filter, count, and summarize data:
     - Listing employees by department IDs.
     - Listing employees by salary range.
     - Counting the total number of employees.
     - Calculating the average salary per department.
     - Sorting employees by salary in ascending order.

This script demonstrates basic operations such as inserting, selecting, updating, and aggregating data, as well as working with primary and foreign key relationships.
