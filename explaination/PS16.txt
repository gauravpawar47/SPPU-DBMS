### Explanation of MongoDB Operations for the `Books` Collection

#### 1. **Creating the `Books` Collection and Inserting Documents**:
```js
db.createCollection('Books');
db.Books.insertMany([
  { 'Title': "Book One", 'Description': "An exciting adventure.", 'Author': "Author A", 'Publisher': "Publisher X", 'URL': "http://example.com/book1", 'no_of_likes': 120 },
  { 'Title': "Book Two", 'Description': "A thrilling mystery.", 'Author': "Author B", 'Publisher': "Publisher Y", 'URL': "http://example.com/book2", 'no_of_likes': 85 },
  { 'Title': "Book Three", 'Description': "A fascinating science fiction.", 'Author': "Author A", 'Publisher': "Publisher X", 'URL': "http://example.com/book3", 'no_of_likes': 150 },
  { 'Title': "Book Four", 'Description': "A captivating romance.", 'Author': "Author C", 'Publisher': "Publisher Z", 'URL': "http://example.com/book4", 'no_of_likes': 95 },
  { 'Title': "Book Five", 'Description': "A compelling drama.", 'Author': "Author B", 'Publisher': "Publisher Y", 'URL': "http://example.com/book5", 'no_of_likes': 100 }
]);
```
- **Creates the `Books` collection** in the MongoDB database.
- **Inserts multiple book documents** into the collection with the following fields:
  - `Title`: Title of the book.
  - `Description`: Brief description of the book.
  - `Author`: Author of the book.
  - `Publisher`: Publisher of the book.
  - `URL`: A URL linking to the book.
  - `no_of_likes`: Number of likes the book has received.

#### 2. **Finding All Books**:
```js
db.Books.find().pretty();
```
- **Finds all documents** in the `Books` collection and formats the output using `.pretty()` for easy readability.

#### 3. **Aggregating to Count Books per Publisher**:
```js
db.Books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$Publisher", 'book_count': { $sum: 1 } } }
]);
```
- **Aggregation pipeline** using the `$group` stage:
  - **Grouping by Publisher**: The books are grouped by the `Publisher` field (`_id: "$Publisher"`).
  - **Counting books per publisher**: The `$sum: 1` operator counts the number of books for each publisher.
- This will return the number of books for each publisher.

#### 4. **Aggregating to Find the Minimum Likes per Author**:
```js
db.Books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$Author", 'min_likes': { $min: "$no_of_likes" } } }
]);
```
- **Aggregation pipeline** using the `$group` stage:
  - **Grouping by Author**: The books are grouped by the `Author` field (`_id: "$Author"`).
  - **Finding the minimum likes**: The `$min` operator returns the smallest value of `no_of_likes` for each author.
- This will return the minimum number of likes received by each author across their books.

#### 5. **Aggregating to Find the Maximum Likes per Author**:
```js
db.Books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$Author", 'max_likes': { $max: "$no_of_likes" } } }
]);
```
- **Aggregation pipeline** using the `$group` stage:
  - **Grouping by Author**: The books are grouped by the `Author` field (`_id: "$Author"`).
  - **Finding the maximum likes**: The `$max` operator returns the largest value of `no_of_likes` for each author.
- This will return the maximum number of likes received by each author across their books.

### Summary of Operations:

- **Creating and inserting books**: The collection is created and populated with five book documents containing details like title, description, author, publisher, URL, and the number of likes.
- **Finding all books**: All books in the collection are retrieved and displayed in a readable format.
- **Count books per publisher**: The number of books for each publisher is counted using the `$group` aggregation stage.
- **Minimum likes per author**: The minimum number of likes for each author is calculated using the `$min` aggregation operator.
- **Maximum likes per author**: The maximum number of likes for each author is calculated using the `$max` aggregation operator.

These aggregation operations provide valuable insights into the data, such as how many books each publisher has, as well as the range of likes received by authors' books.
